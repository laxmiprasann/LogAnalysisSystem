Log Analysis System
Introduction

This project is a Log Analysis System designed to ingest large volumes of log data, search through them efficiently, and provide relevant results to the user. It includes features such as searching for specific log entries, filtering by log level, analyzing logs within a specified time range, and more.

Features

*Ingestion of massive volumes of log data from multiple files.
*Fast and efficient search functionality.
*Scalability to handle increasing volumes of logs.
*User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
*Advanced filtering options for precise log analysis.
*Readable and maintainable codebase.

System Design

The Log Analysis System consists of the following components:
1.Ingestion Module: Responsible for reading log files and storing log entries in a suitable data structure.
2.Search Module: Performs search operations based on user queries and returns relevant log entries.
3.Filtering Module: Filters log entries based on specified criteria such as log level, timestamp range, etc.
4.User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system and view search results.

USAGE:
1.Installation:

*Clone the repository to your local machine.
*Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

2.Running the System:

*Run the main.py script to start the Log Analysis System.
*Use the provided commands or interface to perform various operations such as searching for logs, filtering, etc.

3.Commands:

*python main.py: Launches the Log Analysis System.
*python create_sample_logs.py: Generates sample log files for testing purposes.

4.Additional Notes:

*Ensure that log files are stored in the designated directory (logs/ by default).
*Customize configurations and settings as needed in the config.py file.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

*Implement real-time log streaming functionality.
*Enhance search capabilities with fuzzy matching and natural language processing.
*Integrate machine learning models for anomaly detection in logs.
